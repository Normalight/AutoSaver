## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- System tray application with dynamic right-click menu showing monitored programs and running status (●/○)
- Main window with program list (name, status, interval, actions)
- Two methods to add programs: browse local `.exe` file or pick from running processes with search/filter
- Per-program configurable save interval (1–3600 minutes)
- Automatic `Ctrl+S` injection via `PostMessage` (no focus stealing, works for all visible windows)
- INI-based configuration (`autosaver.ini`) using `GetPrivateProfileString`/`WritePrivateProfileString`
- Dark, light, and system-following themes with runtime switching
- Settings dialog: theme picker, check interval, startup-with-Windows, minimize-to-tray-on-close
- Embedded app icon as managed resource, extracted to temp at runtime
- Rotating log file (`autosaver.log`, max 1 MB, 1 backup)
- Startup-with-Windows via `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` registry key
- `ShutdownMode=OnExplicitShutdown` so closing the window minimizes to tray instead of quitting
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Defensive list copy in `ProcessMonitor.RefreshPrograms` to avoid shared reference bugs
- `Dispatcher.Invoke` wrapping for cross-thread-safe UI updates from `SaveScheduler` timer callbacks
- Centralized `VERSION` file and CHANGELOG.md for release management

### Technical
- C# WPF (.NET Framework 4.8), zero NuGet dependencies, zero runtime install
- P/Invoke for Win32 API: `EnumWindows`, `GetWindowThreadProcessId`, `IsWindowVisible`, `PostMessage`, INI read/write
- `DispatcherTimer` for process monitoring (UI thread), `System.Timers.Timer` for save scheduling (thread pool)
- `NotifyIcon` (Windows Forms) for system tray with dynamic `ContextMenuStrip` rebuild on `Opening` event
- Main window created/destroyed per show cycle (GC-friendly)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD: build on push, create release artifact
- ~300 KB release `.exe`, copy-and-run distribution
